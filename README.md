# electron_multi_dex

A simple umbrella desktop application made using electron.js.
In this app, one can have news, open youtube, get weather report, set a timer, 
clock, stopwatch and even ask a virtual assistant to do certain tasks.
Since it is a demonstrative application, no further improvements will be made.
